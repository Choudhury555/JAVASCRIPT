What is Debounce?
-Debounce delays the execution until after a certain amount of time has passed since the last event.
-In other word(Wait until the user stops doing something, then run the function once.)

Common Use Cases of Debounce:
    -Search input fields – Trigger the search only after the user stops typing.
    -Window resize events – Perform expensive layout calculations only after resizing stops.
    -Auto-save drafts – Save content after the user stops typing for a while.

<input type="text" id="search" placeholder="Type to search..." />

<script>
    function debounce(func, delay) {
        let timeout;
        return function (...args) {
            clearTimeout(timeout);
            timeout = setTimeout(() => func(...args), delay);
        }
    }

    const logInput = debounce((e) => console.log(`Searched for ==> ${e.target.value}`), 3000);
    console.log(logInput);

    document.getElementById("search").addEventListener("input", logInput);
