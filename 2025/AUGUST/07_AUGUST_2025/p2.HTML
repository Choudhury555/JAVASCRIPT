What is Throttle?
-Throttle makes sure a function runs only once every X milliseconds,even if it's triggered many times during that period.
-It limits the rate at which a function executes.

Common Use Cases:
    -Scroll tracking – Update scroll position every 100ms, not on every pixel moved
    -Mouse move – Track mouse position at intervals
    -Resize events – Optimize performance during window resizing

<script>
    function throttle(func, limit) {
        let throttleFlag = false;
        return function () {
            if (throttleFlag == false) {
                func();
                throttleFlag = true;
                setTimeout(() => { throttleFlag = false }, limit);
            }
        }
    }

    const onResize = throttle(() => { console.log("Resized", new Date()) }, 2000);
    console.log(onResize);

    window.addEventListener("resize", onResize);
