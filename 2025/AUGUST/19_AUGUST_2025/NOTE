<!-- Symbol in JavaScript -->
-Symbol is a primitive data type (like number, string, etc.) introduced in ES6.
-Each Symbol() is unique and immutable, even if they have the same description.
-Mainly used as unique object property keys (to avoid accidental overwrites).



<!-- Well-Known Symbols -->
-JavaScript has built-in predefined Symbols called well-known symbols.
-They let us customize object behavior (how objects interact with built-in operations).
    -Symbol.iterator → makes object iterable with for...of.
    -Symbol.toPrimitive → controls type conversion.
    -Symbol.toStringTag → customizes Object.prototype.toString.
    -Symbol.hasInstance → custom instanceof logic.


<!-- Why Symbols Matter? -->
-Hide private/internal properties.
-Prevent accidental overwrites.
-Provide hooks for customizing object behavior.
-Used internally by libraries/frameworks (React uses Symbols for elements).
