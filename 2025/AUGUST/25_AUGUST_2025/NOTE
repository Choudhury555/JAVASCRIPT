<!-- WeakMap & WeakSet -->

<!-- WeakMap -->
-Similar to Map, but keys must be objects.
-Keys are held weakly → if the object is no longer referenced elsewhere, it is garbage collected.
-Not iterable (no for..of, .keys(), .values()).

<!-- WeakSet -->
-Similar to Set, but only stores objects.
-Objects are held weakly → if object is no longer referenced, it’s auto-removed.
-Not iterable, no .size.

<!-- Key Differences (vs Map/Set) -->
-Map/Set → keys/values stay in memory until explicitly deleted.
-WeakMap/WeakSet → auto remove when object is garbage collected.
-WeakMap/WeakSet → only objects allowed, not primitives.
-Not iterable → for privacy & performance reasons.
