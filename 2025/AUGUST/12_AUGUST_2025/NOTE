<==What is a Worker in JavaScript?==>
-A Worker is just an object in JavaScript that represents a background thread.
-It lets your code run in parallel with the main UI thread.
Example:
    -Main thread → handles UI, clicks, animations.
    -Worker thread → handles heavy tasks (math, processing).



<==Main Thread vs Worker Thread==>
-Main Thread → The usual JavaScript execution space that updates your UI.
-Worker Thread → Runs in the background, completely separate from UI.
-They cannot directly access each other’s variables — they communicate by sending messages.


<==How They Talk (Messaging)==>
-Uses .postMessage() to send data.
-Uses onmessage event to receive data.
-Works like a walkie-talkie 📻:
    Main thread sends: “Do this task!”
    Worker sends back: “Here’s the result!”



<==Why Use Workers?==>
-JavaScript is single-threaded → only one task at a time.
-If you run a heavy loop/calculation on the main thread → UI freezes.
-Workers move that heavy task to another thread → UI stays smooth.



<==Worker Lifecycle==>
-Create → new Worker("worker.js")
-Communicate → postMessage() and onmessage
-Terminate → worker.terminate() to free memory.


<==imitations==>
-No DOM access
-Limited global objects
-Runs in isolated scope


<==When to Use Web Workers==>
-Heavy calculations (e.g., large loops, image processing)
-Data parsing (e.g., JSON processing)
-Handling background sync tasks
-Complex algorithms that block the UI


A Worker is a helper JavaScript file that runs in the background, separate from the main UI thread, and communicates through messages so your UI doesn’t freeze.
