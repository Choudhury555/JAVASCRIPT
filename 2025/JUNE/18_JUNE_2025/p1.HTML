    Why Browser Storage?
To persist user data in the browser:
    (i)Without a server
    (ii)Even across page reloads
</p>
<p>localStorage (Permanent until manually cleared)</p>

<script>
    localStorage.setItem("username","Abhisek");
    console.log(localStorage.getItem("username"));//"Abhisek"
    localStorage.setItem("city","Jajpur");
    localStorage.removeItem("username");//remove username property
    localStorage.clear();//Removes All Keys
</script>
