<!-- Reflect API -->
-The Reflect API (introduced in ES6) provides modern, safer, and consistent ways to work with objects. Itâ€™s often paired with Proxies.
-Older methods (Object.defineProperty, delete obj.prop) are inconsistent.
-Reflect provides static methods with consistent return values (true/false instead of throwing).
-Makes meta-programming easier.


<!-- Why Use Reflect? -->
-Safer: returns boolean instead of throwing.
-Works well with Proxy traps.
-Provides uniform, clean APIs.
