<!-- Prototypes & Prototype Chain -->

<!-- What is a Prototype? -->
-Every JavaScript object has an internal property [[Prototype]].
-In most browsers, you can access it via __proto__.
-(Prototype Chain)==>When you access a property, JS looks at the object → if not found, it looks at its prototype → continues until null.

<!-- Function Prototypes -->
-Functions in JS have a special property prototype.(only prototype not __proto__)
-This is used when creating objects via new.

<!-- Overriding & Shadowing -->
-If an object has its own property, it shadows the prototype’s property.

<!-- Why Important? -->
-Backbone of OOP in JavaScript.
-Used in classes (they are just syntactic sugar over prototypes).
